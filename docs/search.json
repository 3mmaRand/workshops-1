    "section": "",
    "text": "Description\nR is a tool for data analysis, but also can be used for self expression. This workshop will be an introduction to creative coding in R in order to make visual art. We will take an inspiration-first approach, using compelling pieces to discuss and learn the techniques that shape the work. This workshop takes guidance from its namesake, the book “Steal Like An Artist” by Austin Kleon - once we have identified and learned to recreate existing works, we will cover how to take this inspiration and transform, remix, or reinterpret it in the pursuit of developing our own work and artistic styles. \n\nThis workshop is hands on and will cover colour theory and manipulation, a reintroduction of the data frame as the foundation for creating art (instead of just for analyzing data!), using ggplot2 as an artistic canvas, creating basic and specialized shapes, tiling and pattern making, developing your own functions and using iteration. We will also discuss how to use controlled randomness to convert a standalone piece into a generative art system that can produce many distinct outputs. Creative coding may seem a world apart from data analysis, but we see a large overlap and intersection of the skills used in both, not to mention the creative muscles that are already used in data visualization.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop is for you if you:\n\nare comfortable with R and RStudio, experience with tidyverse and ggplot2,\nare interested in applying data visualization skills more creatively, but may not know where to start or how to develop style/inspiration, and\nare an artist interested in exploring code as another medium for creating their work,\n\n\n\nInstructor\nIjeamaka Anyene Fumagalli is a full-time senior data analyst in the healthcare space and a free time computational artist. Using code, mainly the R programming language, she creates data art and generative art systems. She loves all things grid based, minimal, and geometric which naturally led to her love for textile arts as well.\nSharla Gelfand is a freelance statistician, software developer, and artist with interests in web development, generative art, and textile arts. Their work explores the play between art created by a computer and by hand, creating generative art that looks like it could have been made by hand (like a textile, drawing, or painting), and making physical art based on data or outputs of a generative system, exploring the strengths and limitations of each."

    "text": "Description\nCommunicating data through meaningful and easily accessible visualization is a critical competence for most data-related roles including data scientists, analysts, scientific researchers, and managers. A well-designed graphic is able to inform, spark engagement, explain patterns, and drive decisions and actions. At the same time, poor choices in the design process can complicate interpretation or even, intentionally or unintentionally, mislead the audience.\nThe aim of this course is to demystify the creative processes of data visualization design to turn data into a meaningful story. Participants will learn helpful tips and tricks to create appealing and informative data visualizations that are not “just showing the numbers” but successfully tell a story. We will cover principles of good data visualization design, explore different options to display data, and discuss ways to guide and engage viewers with the aim to create impactful graphics. The course also features sessions on picking suitable yet beautiful colors, what to consider when choosing and pairing typefaces, and the layout of graphics, also in the context of dashboard building.\n\n\nAudience\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nwant to understand and learn the art of communicating data with impactful visualizations,\naim to improve your data visualization design to create effective and informative graphics, and\nare willing to spend a bit more time to choose the right chart, proper color palettes, and suitable fonts along with additional elements to guide the viewer.\n\n\n\nInstructor\nCédric Scherer is a data visualization designer, consultant, and instructor helping clients and workshop participants to create engaging and effective graphics. As a graduated ecologist, he has acquired an extensive hypothesis–driven research experience and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. As an independent data visualization designer, Cédric later combined his expertise in analyzing large data sets with his passion for design, colors and typefaces.\nCédric has designed graphics across all disciplines, purposes, and styles applying a code–first approach and regularly talks about data visualization design and ggplot2 techniques. Due to regular participation in social data challenges such as #TidyTuesday, he is now well known for complex and visually appealing figures, entirely made with ggplot2, that look as if they have been created with a vector design tool."

    "text": "Description\nIt is common for organizations to collect huge amounts of data over time, and existing time series analysis tools are not always suitable to handle the scale, frequency and structure of the data collected. In this workshop, we will look at some packages and methods that have been developed to handle the analysis of large collections of time series.\nOn day 1, we will look at the tsibble data structure for flexibly managing collections of related time series. We will look at how to do data wrangling, data visualizations and exploratory data analysis. We will explore feature-based methods to explore time series data in high dimensions. A similar feature-based approach can be used to identify anomalous time series within a collection of time series, or to cluster or classify time series. Primary packages for day 1 will be tsibble, lubridate and feasts (along with the tidyverse of course).\nDay 2 will be about forecasting. We will look at some classical time series models and how they are automated in the fable package, and we will explore the creation of ensemble forecasts and hybrid forecasts. Best practices for evaluating forecast accuracy will also be covered. Finally, we will look at forecast reconciliation, allowing millions of time series to be forecast in a relatively short time while accounting for constraints on how the series are related.\n\n\nAudience\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nalready use the tidyverse packages in R such as dplyr, tidyr, tibble and ggplot2,\nneed to analyze large collections of related time series, and\nwould like to learn how to use some tidy tools for time series analysis including visualization, decomposition and forecasting.\n\n\n\nInstructor\nRob J Hyndman is Professor of Statistics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University.
