    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nR is a tool for data analysis, but also can be used for self expression. This workshop will be an introduction to creative coding in R in order to make visual art. We will take an inspiration-first approach, using compelling pieces to discuss and learn the techniques that shape the work. This workshop takes guidance from its namesake, the book “Steal Like An Artist” by Austin Kleon - once we have identified and learned to recreate existing works, we will cover how to take this inspiration and transform, remix, or reinterpret it in the pursuit of developing our own work and artistic styles. \n\nThis workshop is hands on and will cover colour theory and manipulation, a reintroduction of the data frame as the foundation for creating art (instead of just for analyzing data!), using ggplot2 as an artistic canvas, creating basic and specialized shapes, tiling and pattern making, developing your own functions and using iteration. We will also discuss how to use controlled randomness to convert a standalone piece into a generative art system that can produce many distinct outputs. Creative coding may seem a world apart from data analysis, but we see a large overlap and intersection of the skills used in both, not to mention the creative muscles that are already used in data visualization.\n\n\nTarget audience\nThis course will be appropriate if:\n\nyou are comfortable with R and RStudio, experience with tidyverse and ggplot2\nyou are interested in applying data visualization skills more creatively, but may not know where to start or how to develop style/inspiration\nyou are an artists interested in exploring code as another medium for creating their work\n\n\n\nBio\nIjeamaka Anyene Fumagalli is a full-time senior data analyst in the healthcare space and a free time computational artist. Using code, mainly the R programming language, she creates data art and generative art systems. She loves all things grid based, minimal, and geometric which naturally led to her love for textile arts as well.\nSharla Gelfand is a freelance statistician, software developer, and artist with interests in web development, generative art, and textile arts. Their work explores the play between art created by a computer and by hand, creating generative art that looks like it could have been made by hand (like a textile, drawing, or painting), and making physical art based on data or outputs of a generative system, exploring the strengths and limitations of each."

A well-designed graphic is able to inform, spark engagement, explain patterns, and drive decisions and actions. At the same time, poor choices in the design process can complicate interpretation or even, intentionally or unintentionally, mislead the audience.\nThe aim of this course is to demystify the creative processes of data visualization design to turn data into a meaningful story. Participants will learn helpful tips and tricks to create appealing and informative data visualizations that are not “just showing the numbers” but successfully tell a story. We will cover principles of good data visualization design, explore different options to display data, and discuss ways to guide and engage viewers with the aim to create impactful graphics. The course also features sessions on picking suitable yet beautiful colors, what to consider when choosing and pairing typefaces, and the layout of graphics, also in the context of dashboard building.\n\n\nTarget audience\nThis course is for you if:\n\nyou want to understand and learn the art of communicating data with impactful visualizations\nyou aim to improve your data visualization design to create effective and informative graphics\nyou are willing to spend a bit more time to choose the right chart, proper color palettes, and suitable fonts along with additional elements to guide the viewer\n\n\n\nBio\nCédric Scherer is a data visualization designer, consultant, and instructor helping clients and workshop participants to create engaging and effective graphics.
