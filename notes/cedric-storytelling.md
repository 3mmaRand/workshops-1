# Title

- Option 1: Engaging Data Visualization Design to Successfully Tell a Story
- Option 2: Engaging Visualization Design for Successful Data Communication

# Abstract

Communicating data through meaningful and easily accessible visualization is a critical competence for most data-related roles including data scientists, analysts, and scientific researchers \[1\]. A well-designed graphic is able to inform, spark engagement, explain patterns, and drive decisions and actions. At the same time, poor choices in the design process can complicate interpretation or even, intentionally or unintentionally, mislead the audience.

The aim of this course is to demystify the creative processes of data visualization design to turn data into a meaningful story. Participants will learn helpful tips and tricks to create appealing and informative data visualizations that are not "just showing the numbers" but successfully tell a story. We will cover principles of good data visualization design, explore different options to display data, and discuss ways to guide and engage viewers with the aim to create impactful graphics. The course also features sessions on picking suitable yet beautiful colors, what to consider when choosing and pairing typefaces, and the layout of graphics, also in the context of dashboard building.

# Target audience

This course is for you if:

-   you want to understand and learn the art of communicating data with impactful visualizations

-   you aim to improve your data visualization design to create effective and informative graphics

-   you are willing to spend a bit more time to choose the right chart, proper color palettes, and suitable fonts along with additional elements to guide the viewer

\[1\] include "managers" here?

# Bio

[Cédric Scherer](https://cedricscherer.com) is a data visualization designer, consultant, and instructor helping clients and workshop participants to create engaging and effective graphics. As a graduated ecologist, he has acquired an extensive hypothesis--driven research experience and problem--solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. As an independent data visualization designer, Cédric later combined his expertise in analyzing large data sets with his passion for design, colors and typefaces.

Cédric has designed graphics across all disciplines, purposes, and styles applying a code--first approach and regularly talks about data visualization design and ggplot2 techniques. Due to regular participation in social data challenges such as [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), he is now well known for complex and visually appealing figures, entirely made with ggplot2, that look as if they have been created with a vector design tool.
