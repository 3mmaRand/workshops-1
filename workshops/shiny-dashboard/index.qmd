# Abstract

In this workshop we will explore all of the interesting and variety ways you can use shiny: from adding dynamic elements to your existing RMarkdown / Quarto documents, to building and deploying dashboards for reporting, and customizing the appearance and themeing of the app (and your outplots like plots and tables).
This workshop assumes that you have a basic familiarity with Shiny (e.g. the ability to write simple apps and basics of reactivety).
