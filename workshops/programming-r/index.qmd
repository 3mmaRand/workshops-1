# Description

This is a one-day, hands-on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and want to improve their R programming skills and, especially, reduce the amount of duplication in their code.
The two main ways to reduce duplication are creating functions and using iteration.
We will use a tidyverse approach to cover function design and iteration with purrr.

In this workshop you will master the art of writing functions that do one thing well, adhere to existing conventions and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems.
You will also learn how to perform the same action on many objects using code which is succinct and easy to read.

# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   have experience equivalent to an introductory data science course using tidyverse
-   feel comfortable with the [Whole game](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game.html) part of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
