# Description

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that is built on Pandoc.
With Quarto, you can author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layouts, and more.
In this workshop, you will learn how to use Quarto for technical communication and computation.
We'll teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) leveraging integrations with both IPython/Jupyter and the Quarto VS Code extension.
We will also touch on authoring scientific manuscripts that adhere to specific journal styles as well as creating Quarto projects for aggregating many files such as complex websites or entire books.
Additionally, we'll walk you through multilingual projects as well as publishing on QuartoPub.

The learning outcomes for the workshop include:

-   demonstrating how Quarto can enhance your existing reproducible authoring tools and workflows,

-   leveraging your reproducible authoring skills to create single Quarto documents,

-   taking control of execution and layout options in computational documents,

-   creating Quarto projects that bring together multiple Quarto documents as websites or books,

-   authoring fully reproducible scientific manuscripts ready for journal submission, and

-   extending Quarto with shortcodes and filters.

# Audience

This workshop is for you if you:

-   have some experience with Python and Jupyter and who want to learn how Quarto can support and enhance your workflows,
-   want to learn about going from notebooks to reproducible scientific publications, and
-   are interested in creating websites or writing books from Jupyter notebooks.

You do not need to be an advanced user of Python or Jupyter, however, the workshop will assume that you have authored computational documents before.

# Instructors

This workshop will be taught by members of the Quarto Development Team.
