# Abstract

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that is built on Pandoc.
With Quarto, you can author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layouts, and more.
In this workshop, you will learn how to use Quarto for technical communication and computation.
We'll teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) leveraging integrations with both IPython/Jupyter and the Quarto VS Code extension.
We will also touch on authoring scientific manuscripts that adhere to specific journal styles as well as creating Quarto projects for aggregating many files such as complex websites or entire books.
Additionally, we'll walk you through multilingual projects as well as publishing on QuartoPub.

The learning outcomes for the workshop include:

-   Demonstrate how Quarto can enhance your existing reproducible authoring tools and workflows

-   Leverage your reproducible authoring skills to create single Quarto documents

-   Take control of execution and layout options in computational documents

-   Create Quarto projects that bring together multiple Quarto documents as websites or books

-   Author fully reproducible scientific manuscripts ready for journal submission

-   Extend Quarto with shortcodes and filters

# Target audience

This workshop is designed for those who have some experience with Python and Jupyter and who want to learn how Quarto can support and enhance their workflows for going from notebooks to reproducible publications.
You do not need to be an advanced user of any of these, however, the workshop will assume that you have authored computational documents before.
