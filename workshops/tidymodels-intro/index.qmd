# Description

This workshop will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and basic pre-processing with recipes.
Time permitting, you'll be introduced to model optimization using the tune package.
You'll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.

# Audience

This workshop is for you if you:

-   have intermediate R knowledge, experience with tidyverse packages, and either of the R pipes,
-   can read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs, and
-   have had some exposure to basic statistical concepts such as linear models, random forests, etc.

Intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning is not required.
