# Description

Data analysis pipelines with big or larger-than-memory data are becoming more and more commonplace. In this workshop you will learn how to use Apache Arrow, a multi-language toolbox for working with larger-than-memory tabular data, to create seamless data analysis pipelines with larger-than-memory data from R. 
  
The workshop will focus on using the the arrow R package---a mature R interface to Apache Arrow---to create and use interoperable data file formats like Parquet for efficient data storage and access, on disk and in cloud storage. You'll learn how to exercise fine control over data types to avoid common large data pipeline problems, and you'll learn to process larger-than-memory files and multi-file data sets with familiar dplyr syntax. This workshop will provide a foundation for using arrow, giving you access to a powerful suite of tools for performant analysis of larger-than-memory data in R.


# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   want to learn how to work with tabular data that is too large to fit in memory using familiar-to-you R and tidyverse syntax

-   want to learn about the Parquet file format, a powerful and interoperable alternative to CSV files

-   want to learn how to engineer how your tabular data is stored for more performant access and analysis with Apache Arrow
