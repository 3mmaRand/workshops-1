# Abstract

In this one-day masterclass, you'll have the opportunity to dig deep into package development.
We'll cover a selection of cutting-edge topics (e.g. advanced testing tools, writing actionable error messages) that have significantly impacted the way we develop packages in the last couple of years.
There will be plenty of time to apply what you learn to your own package, in an environment where you can get help and talk things through with the tidyverse team.

# Target audience

This course is for you if:

-   you have already developed one or more packages, and are preared to work on them during with workshop.
-   you are familiar with the basic devtools/RStudio workflow (e.g. `load_all()`, roxygen2, testthat, and usethis)
-   you are familiar with Git
