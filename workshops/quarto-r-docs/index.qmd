# Description

This workshop will prepare you to author a rich array of documents in Quarto, the next generation of R Markdown.
Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that offers multilingual programming language support to create dynamic and static documents, books, presentations, blogs, and other online resources.

The focus for this workshop will be on single documents.
You will learn to create static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and htmlwidgets, or steer them in the direction of sophisticated scientific documents.
In the afternoon you'll take the same authoring approaches to create slide presentations in various formats such as reveal.js, beamer, and pptx.

# Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   have a basic knowledge of how to use the RStudio IDE,

-   have experience with R Markdown, or

-   are excited to author a range of reproducible computational documents types, from static files to slides.

Seasoned users of R Markdown will get more out of the [Advanced Quarto with R and RStudio: Projects, Websites, Books, and More](/quarto-r-projects) workshop, which is focused on projects, a distinct strength of Quarto in authoring work that spans multiple documents.
