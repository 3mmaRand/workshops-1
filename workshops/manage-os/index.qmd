# Description

An open source project starts with ideas and code, but it continues with people.
We know that most open source projects rely on just one or two people for most of the work.
And code is just a small part of these roles, which also include project management, conflict resolution, decision making in uncertain situations, building an inclusive community, and lots and lots of communication.
Whether you're just starting a project, interested in getting involved in open source, or already have a community of thousands, there are some tips, tricks and templates that you can use to make maintaining an open source project more manageable.

In this interactive 1-day workshop you'll learn some key practices for effect open source project management.
You'll walk away with new approaches for making project decisions, better strategies to manage user and contributor interactions, and better ways to set boundaries.
Different projects make different decisions based on their needs and in this workshop you'll see what types of decisions are possible, and how you can make the ones appropriate for you.
During the workshop, you'll create useful documents for your repository and begin to outline some processes you can finalize later or with your team.
