# Description

In this workshop, we will discuss ways to better containerize, deploy, and scale your data products. We'll use both R and shell scripting to virtualize Posit products in the cloud. You'll learn about servers, networking, security, and authorization to be dangerous -- or at least to understand your DevSecOps teams. By the end of the workshop you will have the tools to start deploying your own data science assets into production.

# Audience

This workshop is for you if you:

-   are a data scientist or analyst who wants to put their work into production,

-   want to learn a more about Docker containers and virtual machines, or

-   want to better understand importance of networking, security, storage, and different server architectures to deploying data apps.
