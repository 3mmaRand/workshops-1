# Description

There has been significant innovation in introductory statistics and data science courses to equip students with the statistical, computing, and communication skills needed for modern data analysis.
Success in data science and statistics is dependent on the development of both analytical and computational skills, and the demand for educators who are proficient at teaching both these skills is growing.
The goal of this masterclass is to equip educators with concrete information on content, workflows, and infrastructure for *painlessly* introducing modern computation with R and RStudio within a data science curriculum.

Topics will cover teaching the tidyverse in 2023, highlighting updates to *R for Data Science (2nd ed)* and *Data Science in a Box* as well as present tooling options and workflows for reproducible authoring, computing infrastructure, version control, and collaboration.
In a nutshell, the day you'll spend in this workshop will save you hours and hours of solo work designing and setting up your course.

The workshop will be comprised of four modules:

-   Teaching data science with the tidyverse and Quarto
-   Teaching data science with Git and GitHub
-   Organizing, publishing, and sharing of course materials
-   Computing infrastructure for teaching data science

Throughout each module we'll shift between the student perspective and the instructor perspective.
The activities and demos will be hands-on; attendees will also have the opportunity to exchange ideas and ask questions throughout the session.

In addition to gaining technical knowledge, participants will engage in discussion around the decisions that go into developing a data science curriculum and choosing workflows and infrastructure that best support the curriculum and allow for scalability.
We will also discuss best practices for configuring and deploying classroom infrastructures to support these tools.

# Audience

This masterclass is aimed primarily at participants teaching data science in an academic setting in semester-long courses, however much of the information and tooling we introduce is applicable for shorter teaching experiences like workshops and bootcamps as well.
Basic knowledge of R is assumed and familiarity with the tidyverse and Git is preferred.

This course is for you if you:

-   you want to learn / discuss curriculum, pedagogy, and computing infrastructure design for teaching data science with R and RStudio using the tidyverse and Quarto,
-   you are interested in setting up your class in Posit Cloud,
-   you want to integrate version control with git into your teaching and learn about tools and best practices for running your course on GitHub.
