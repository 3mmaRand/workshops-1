# Abstract

You will learn about model optimization using the tune package and deepen your understanding of what's possible in preprocessing with recipes.
Additionally, we'll highlight time series analysis using tidymodels.
Time permitting, model ensembles via stacking will be introduced.
This course is focused on the analysis of tabular data and does not include deep learning methods.
Participants who have completed the \"Introduction to tidymodels\" workshop will be well-prepared for this course.

# Target audience

This workshop is for you if you:

-   have completed the \"Introduction to tidymodels\" workshop will be well-prepared for this workshop
-   have used tidymodels packages like recipes, rsample, and parsnip and are comfortable with tidyverse syntax (e.g. piping, mutates, pivoting)
-   have experience with resampling and modeling (but no requirement to be an expert). For example, participants could understand/have used linear regression or random forests, etc.
